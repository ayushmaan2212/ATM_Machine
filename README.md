# 🏧 ATM Machine Simulation (Java OOP)

A console-based ATM Machine Simulation built using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
This project mimics basic ATM functionalities and demonstrates clean code structure, modular design, and practical application of Java concepts.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application simulates how an ATM works, allowing users to perform common banking operations such as:

- Balance Inquiry
- Cash Withdrawal
- Deposit Money
- User Authentication (PIN Verification)

The primary objective of this project is to strengthen understanding of **Java fundamentals** and **OOP concepts** through a real-world inspired system.
